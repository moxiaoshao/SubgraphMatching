# SubgraphMatching
Subgraph matching algorithms and improvements
<br>
This repository has implementation of subgraph matching algorithms and improvements like <br>
a. optimized search space calculations, <br>b.neighborhood profiling <br>c. optimized search order<br> d. optimized methods for verifying subgraph isomorphism.
<br><br>

1. Transforming different datasets into Neo4j data graphs <br>
GraphTransformTest.java - transformiGRAPHFormat, transformProteinsFormat function transforms data into Neo4j data graphs.<br>
SubgraphTest.java - transformProteinsFormat, transformiGRAPHFormat function helps in storing the subgraph query<br>

2.- Implementation of subgraph matching algorithms and improvements can be found in SubgraphTest.java file.
